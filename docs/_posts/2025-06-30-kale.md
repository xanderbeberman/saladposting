Wow... 30 days... what can I say... I'd like to thank to my parents for always believing in me, and especially my mom and Nanny for letting me eat their leftover salads. Thank you to Regina, Yael, and Rubin for making me salad, and to all my other friends who have supported me during this time. Thank you to Medukha for accommodating me even while on tour. Thank you to the Park Slope Food Coop (though, honestly, they should really be thanking me!) despite not passing the referendum on hybrid meetings. Thank you to all of you who looked at this website and felt inspired or amused or annoyed. To everyone out there: believe in yourself and never give upâ€”you can do anything you set your mind to. Just remember to eat your vegetables!

Stay tuned to see if a special guest takes over the Salad Challenge in July...
